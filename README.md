# ArduinoRSSIMeter

<h2>Simple Arduino RSSI Meter</h2>

This is a very simple RSSI Meter made with Arduino.
For LCD I prefer the version with I2C for less connections.

Keep the button in D12 pressed to enter in configuration mode.
- VRX On / VTX Off to set the 0% RSSI signal
- VRX On / VTX On to set the 100% RSSI signal

The values are saved in EEPROM. No need to change the source code
to adjust the values comming from your Video RX.
